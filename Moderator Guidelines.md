# Overview

As a moderator your main responsibility is to actively (or at least semi-actively) interact with the community, contribute to friendly conversations and make new members feel welcomed.
Basically ensure a nice atmosphere for everyone and be someone other members can look up to :heart:

Things such as handing out warns and taking actions against bad actors only comes after.

We highly suggest you read through the quality resources available at (DMA) **Discord Moderation Academy:**
<https://discord.com/moderation>
This will greatly aid you in efficiently moderating not only this server but any community.

Below will be information about moderation standards & tools of this server. We will go over them one by one.

# Moderation Standard

You are *required* to warn members for __each and every__ rule violation. If it's something trivial or silly then just tell them softly or overlook the case but do make a note of it.

If a member breaks a rule from the **__same__** category:
```
2nd time: 1 week timeout
3rd time: 1 week ban
4th time: 3 month ban

Any further rule violation will result in a permanent ban with no appeal.
```

You may forgive warns older than 3 months if the member seems to have improved.

Note; this doesn't mean moderators must follow this order as some of our rules are 0 tolerance. Hence you are allowed to take actions based on severity.

# Zero Tolerance Rules

- **Respect & Etiquette**
    - **9, 10:** *(doxxing & discrimination)*
- **Communication**
    - **12:** *(discussion of detailed nsfw)*
- **Profile & Media Sharing**
    - **1, 2, 7, 8** *(profile promoting adult content/breaking tos, alts/ddos attack, stealing content/breach of licence, nsfw media/streaming)*

0 tolerance rule violations __must__ be reported to discord if relevant before purging the messages & banning.

Note; even in this category some cases may not be as severe or just borderline. If so just give a stern warning against it or @Moderators to call a discussion.

# Trolls, Spam Bots & Raids

If you find anyone blatantly breaking rules solely to cause drama mute them permanently. *(Report to discord and ban if any major rules have been broken.)*

If evident an account is botted, report and ban immediately. *(If it's a hacked account of an existing member only kick the user.)*

Bot raids shouldn't be able to get past verification unless it's a group of individuals or numerous alts manually verified. In such a case lockdown the server, report 3-4 users and ban the rest.
If any server was promoted make sure you copy that server ID/invite.

# Tools & Actions

## Applications

Applications are the easiest way to warn, mute, kick or ban a user or bulk delete/purge messages. It is encouraged to use this mode to avoid mistakes but you may use commands instead if you are more experienced and confident with that.

## Commands

Note; some features are not available in applications and you will need to use commands itself.

### Warn
ㅤ
- `/warns [user]`
    - Gets all warns about a user.
- `/warn [user] [reason]`
    - use this if you can't use the application.

You don't need to panic or feel hasty in any situation, feel free to take your time to think through or discuss with other moderators if you are ever in doubt :heart:

### Mute

- `/mute [user] [duration] [reason]`
    - use this if you can't use the application.
    - ex: `/mute @troll 7d spamming`
    - ex: `/mute @memer 3h spamming`
- `/unmute [user] [reason]`
    - use this if you can't use the application.

You are allowed to mute members *potentially* involved in an argument if you cannot make a proper decision immediately. You can unmute those not guilty shortly after.

Note; you may also mute using the 'timeout' option in members profile but try to avoid this method as it can be bypassed.

### Kick

- `/kick [user] [reason]`
    - use this if you can't use the application.

In some cases where a member cannot fix their mistake immediately, you can kick them. *ex: a new member joins with nsfw pfp but are not online to change it.*

### Ban

- `/ban [user] [duration] [reason]
    - use this if you can't use the application.
- `/unban [user] [reason]`

### Lockdown

- `/lockdown` (lock server)
- `/lockdown end` (unlock server)
- `/lock #channel`
- `/unlock #channel`

You can lock down the particular channel or the whole server if too many members are involved in an argument, raid etc..

### Case

- `/caseinfo [id]`
    - get information about a particular case (warn, ban, mute, note etc..)
- `/caselist [user]`
    - see case history for everyone or just a particular user.
- `/caseupdate [id] [info]`
    - update information about a case.
 - `/casedelete [id]`
    - delete a particular case.

### Notes

- `/usernotes <user>`
    - get all notes on a user.
- `/usernotes <user> [note]`
    - add a note to a user.

Notes are similar to warns but it's only for moderators to provide further detail and insight on a particular user for other moderators to take more appropriate decisions.

### Nick

- `/setnick [user] [nickname]`
    - edit your nickname or another user's nickname.

# Practical

It is easier to handle a situation that might arise when you're present in chat. But what if something started in your absence and is happening when you just came online?
Then you might need to backread a little to understand what's going on to be able to take proper decision.

Though before you do that make sure you tell the members involved to stop/move on (verbal warning.) Ofcourse, you can mute any of them persistently involved temporarily even if you don't have immediate evidence they did something wrong.

Once that is sorted, you can analyze the situation at your own pace and take action accordingly.
- That person who might've got caught in the cross-fire?
    - Just unmute them if they didn't do anything wrong and clarify it was simply part of moderation; to calm down the atmosphere.

- What if something already happened & ended in your absence?
    - In an active server, back-reading everything is simply not possible and something you can't waste your time on. Just skim through all the new messages, only stop to check closely if you notice anything wrong. You also don't need to bother too much if you see another moderator part of those conversations and taken care of it.

Another way is to check #members-log & #messages-log, if you notice any inappropriate behaviour, you can go back to those chats to check nothing went wrong.

# Accountability

As a moderator, you have an expected level of accountability. A member is expected to admit when they’re in the wrong, and as a mod, even more so. You should hold members accountable for their actions, but also you should hold other co-mods, admins, and yourself accountable for their actions. This will help establish a level of trust that you and everyone else is willing to change. Similarly, if someone holds you accountable, take it seriously. Weigh the reasons for the confrontation, and be willing to adapt.

# Staff Communication

Communication skills are key to effective moderation. This can include catching up and/or explaining certain scenarios that have gone down, but can also include more personal things that might hinder one's ability to moderate in certain situations It is important that all active moderators are aware of different situations around the server, so as to not give undeserved "leniency" or hostility.

By ensuring everyone is aware of events on this server, this can be avoided since all the facts are there, it's just up to interpretation. For a similar reason, it's helpful to discuss actions with other moderators before taking them. This is not always necessary, but some non-immediate situations may first go through a review Personal things can include stuff such as the inability to moderate on certain days/times because of some other factor. It could also include biases towards certain members, if you've interacted with them before.

Being able to communicate certain topics with other moderators creates an open environment of trust and a reassurance that others will step in to assist. To protect from really personal information, it's okay to generalize some information when discussing, but make sure the point is communicated across.
