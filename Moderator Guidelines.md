As a moderator your main responsibility is to actively (or at least semi-actively) interact with the community, contribute to friendly conversations and make new members feel welcomed.
Basically ensure a nice atmosphere for everyone and be someone other members can look up to :heart:

Things such as handing out warns and taking actions against bad actors only comes after.

We highly suggest you read through the quality resources available at (DMA) **Discord Moderation Academy:**
<https://discord.com/moderation>
This will greatly aid you in efficiently moderating not only this server but any community.

Below will be information about moderation standards & tools of this server. We will go over them one by one.
- Moderation Standard
- 0 Tolerance Rules
- Trolls, Spam Bots & Raids

- Accountability
- Staff Communication
- Leave & Resignation

# Moderation Standard

You are *required* to warn members for __each and every__ rule violation. If it's something trivial or silly then just tell them softly or overlook the case.

If a member breaks a rule from the **__same__** category:
```
2nd time: 1 week timeout
3rd time: 1 week ban
4th time: 3 month ban

Any further rule violation will result in a permanent ban with no appeal.
```

You may forgive warns older than 3 months if the member seems to have improved.

Note; this doesn't mean moderators must follow this order as some of our rules are 0 tolerance. Hence you are allowed to take actions based on severity.

# Zero Tolerance Rules

**Respect & Etiquette**
- **9, 10:** *(doxxing & discrimination)*

**Communication**
- **12:** *(discussion of detailed nsfw)*

**Profile & Media Sharing**
- **1, 2, 7, 8** *(profile promoting adult content/breaking tos, alts/ddos attack, stealing content/breach of licence, nsfw media/streaming)*

0 tolerance rule violations __must__ be reported to discord if relevant before purging the messages & banning.

Note; even in this category some cases may not be as severe or just borderline. If so just give a stern warning against it.

# Trolls, Spam Bots & Raids

If you find anyone blatantly breaking rules solely to cause drama mute them permanently. *(Report to discord and permban if any major rules have been broken.)*

If evident an account is botted, report and ban immediately. *(If it's a hacked account of an existing member only kick the user.)*

Bot raids shouldn't be able to get past verification unless it's a group of individuals or numerous alts manually verified. In such a case lockdown the server, report 3-4 users and ban the rest.
If any server was promoted make sure you copy that server ID/invite.

# Tools & Actions

## Applications
![20230403_085653](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99989764/232468906-70f8344c-25ca-44b7-b215-10176c562c58.png)

## Commands

If you remember the syntax you can use ` ! ` prefix else use ` / ` with auto-suggestions and auto-complete.

### mute
- `!mute @user <duration>`
    - ex: `!mute @troll 7d`
    - ex: `!mute @memer 3h`

You are allowed to mute members *potentially* involved in an argument if you cannot make a proper decision immediately. You can unmute those not guilty shortly after.

Note; you may also mute using the 'timeout' option in members profile.

### lockdownㅤ
- `!lockdown` (lock server)
- `!lockdown end` (unlock server)
- `!lock #channel`
- `!unlock #channel`

You can lock down the particular channel or the whole server if too many members are involved in an argument, raid etc..

### kick

- `!kick @user`

In some cases where a member cannot fix their mistake immediately, you can kick them. *ex: a new member joins with nsfw pfp but are not online to change it.*

### ban

- `!ban noappeal @user toxicity`
    - *permanent ban, delete messages, no appeal*
- `!ban @user 7d spamming`
    - *temporay ban, delete messages*
- `!ban save @user 7d arguing`
    - *temporary ban, save messages.*

### warn
ㅤ
- `!warnings @user` (see warnings for a user)
- `!reason @user [ID] [reason]` (edit/supply reason for a mod case)
- `!warn @user [reason]`

With every warn you __must__ mention rule from which category was broken. You can choose to simply copy-paste from rules like so:
```
!warn @user
**Rule A**
> 2. Avoid disturbing staff or other members with pings, especially if asked not to. (including reply ping)
```
Although make sure you are being very clear in the context of that particular case. So you are free to write your own reason and explanation in reference to our rules. ex:
```
!warn @user **Rule B** persistent arguing
```

Make sure to advise the member to direct any further messages about it to #contact-staff. Also ask them to next time ask staff if they're in doubt or to go through the rules to avoid getting in trouble again.

You don't need to panic or feel hasty in any situation, feel free to take your time to think through or discuss with other moderators if you are ever in doubt :heart:

# Practical

It is easier to handle a situation that might arise when you're present in chat. But what if something started in your absence and is happening when you just came online?
Then you might need to backread a little to understand what's going on to be able to take proper decision.

Though before you do that make sure you tell the members involved to stop/move on (verbal warning.) Ofcourse, you can mute any of them persistently involved temporarily even if you don't have immediate evidence they did something wrong.

Once that is sorted, you can analyze the situation at your own pace and take action accordingly.
- That person who might've got caught in the cross-fire?
    - Just unmute them if they didn't do anything wrong and clarify it was simply part of moderation; to calm down the atmosphere.

- What if something already happened & ended in your absence?
    - In an active server, back-reading everything is simply not possible and something you can't waste your time on. Just skim through all the new messages, only stop to check closely if you notice anything wrong. You also don't need to bother too much if you see another moderator part of those conversations and taken care of it.

Another way is to check #members-log & #messages-log, if you notice any inappropriate behaviour, you can go back to those chats to check nothing went wrong.
