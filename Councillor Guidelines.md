# Role Info

The council members are incharge of actively proposing changes to improve server alongside community feedback and collectively making key decisions in a well-informed manner. Members of the council have a vote each in finalising decisions.

# Your Importance

Bedrock Commands Community is a very general group for anyone and everyone who share the love for Minecraft and commands. It does not belong to any one individual or a particular group.<br>
It is a "community" server. Therefore, it is important that all the decisions dictating the present and future of the server must also be made by these members of the community.

However, it is also important to note that, not every member is equally capable of making well informed decisions in a civil manner and a community that is "full democracy" only leads to chaos.<br>
Hence, this requires we establish a team of capable councillors who will listen to the voice of each group, weigh the pros and cons of the options and collectively make well informed decisions for the community.

# Decision Making

- **Feedback**
    - Any new change to the community must go through #server-feedback channel.
    - If it is something really not suitable to bring up in public, resort to making the decision in private with the involvment of council members only.

- **Discussion**
    - All feedback in #server-feedback must have a somewhat thorough discussion from the community members and council before proceeding further.

- **Voting**
    - When the discussion comes to an end after considering the pros and cons of each option, it can be concluded with a public vote within the post.
    - In more difficult or major decisions, a private vote can be held for only council members to decide and addtionaly a public vote through #announcments if needed.
    - In case some council members are absent, the decision through private vote can be finalised as long as at least 80% of the team was involved.

- **Implementing Change**
    - Once the feedback has been considered by the community members and council, it will be implemented by the server owners (admins) after careful review and approval.

# Permissions

Council members have access to a private channel for council discussions and voting but no additonal permissions than a normal member.

# Responsibilities

- As a representative for the Bedrock Commands community, it is important that you strictly uphold our community standards, rules & guidelines.
- Make sure other council members and moderators also adhere to it. and hold them accountable for their actions.
- Maintain a strong cohesion with the moderation department. Moderators and councillors are equally important and one role isn't superior to the other.
- A lack of responsibility will result in you being removed from the team.
