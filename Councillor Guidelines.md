# BC Council Members

The council members are incharge of actively proposing changes to improve server alongside community feedback and collectively making key decisions in a well-informed manner. Members of the council have a vote each in finalising decisions.

# Importance of Council Members

Bedrock Commands Community is a very general group for anyone and everyone who share the love for Minecraft and commands. It does not belong to any one individual or a particular group.<br>
It is a "community" server. Therefore, it is important that all the decisions dictating the present and future of the server must also be made by these members of the community.

However, it is also important to note that, not every member is equally capable of making well informed decisions in a civil manner and a community that is "full democracy" only leads to chaos.<br>
Hence, this requires we establish a team of capable councillors who will listen to the voice of each group, weigh the pros and cons of the options and collectively make well informed decisions for the community.

# Decision Making

- **Feedback**
    - Any new change to the community must go through #server-feedback channel.
    - If it is something really not suitable to bring up in public, resort to making the decision in private with the involvment of council members only.

- **Discussion**
    - All feedback in #server-feedback must have a somewhat thorough discussion from the community members and council before proceeding further.

- **Voting**
    - When the discussion comes to an end after considering the pros and cons of each option, it can be concluded with a public vote within the post.
    - In more difficult or major decisions, a private vote can be made for only council members to decide and addtionaly a public vote through #announcments if needed.
